# DriverDrowsiness

## Description
A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and deep learning. This project was created as the Honours year project in the department of applied mathematics at Stellenbosch university. The project detects the driver features in real-time decides on the drowsiness level of the person with a self-trained convolutional neural network.
The project may be readily installed and many improved upon.
